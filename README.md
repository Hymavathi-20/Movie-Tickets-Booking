# Movie-Tickets-Booking

- The project is a simple Python-based application designed to book movie tickets, created to apply Python concepts learned during the first semester.
- Users can select movies, choose showtimes, and book tickets, simulating the movie booking process.
- The application provides a user-friendly interface, handles seat selection, and confirms bookings.
- It reinforced Python skills such as working with user input, conditionals, loops, and data structures (like lists and dictionaries) to manage movie details and ticket availability.
